# ECE202 WASM
This is a course project of EE202 embedded system. The group members are Ximeng Liu and Yiru Wang.
Project #11 Framework to Expose IoT Sensor and Actuator Services.

# Abstract
  DDFlow a macroprogramming abstraction and accompanying runtime that provides an efficient means to program high-quality distributed applications that span a diverse and dynamic IoTnetwork. RemedIoT is a remedial action framework for resolving Internet-of-Things conflicts. 
  
  We intent to learn the WASM into details and implement it onto the general embedded devices under distributed and heterogeneous settings. To achieve the goal, we would firstly build some simple sensing and actuation system on devices like Raspberry Pi. Then, we would implement the WASM on the devices to transmit data between them. Finally, we would like to generalize the program so that it can be run in distributed and heterogeneous settings. In the future, maybe we can combine it with the framework with DDFlow and RemedIoT, and introduce some network protocols between the devices using WASM to improve the performance.
